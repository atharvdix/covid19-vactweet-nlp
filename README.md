<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>In this project, sentiment analysis is performed on COVID-19 vaccine tweets. Analysis is done on two Kaggle datasets. The first dataset is by Gabriel Preda, "COVID-19 All Vaccine Tweets" (<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/gpreda/all-covid19-vaccines-tweets/">Dataset 1</a>), and the second dataset is by Kash, "Covid Vaccine Tweets" (<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/kaushiksuresh147/covidvaccine-tweets/">Dataset 2</a>). The combined dataset consists of around 350,000 records (at the time of the analysis). The data analytics framework used for the project is <a href="https://spark.apache.org/">Apache Spark</a>.
